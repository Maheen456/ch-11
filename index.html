    <h3>Block Chain</h3>
    <p>A<b>blockchain</b> is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database,
        a
        blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial
        role in cryptocurrency systems, such as<i>Bitcoin</i>, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of
        transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of
        data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.</p>
    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p><b>Artificial intelligence</b>(AI) broadly refers to any human-like behavior displayed by a machine or system. In
        AI’s most basic form, computers are programmed to<i>“mimic”</i> human behavior using extensive data from past
        examples of similar behavior. This can range from recognizing differences between a cat and a bird to performing
        complex activities in a manufacturing facility.
    </p>
    <h3>Internet Of Things</h3>
    <p>The<b>Internet of things</b> (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with <i>sensors,
            processing
            ability, software, and other technologies</i> that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems
        over the
        Internet or other communications networks</p>
    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
    <p><b>Cloud computing</b> is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking,
        software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible
        resources, and economies of scale</p>
